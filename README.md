### Hello Everyone!

My name is Zane Torregrossa.
I am just beginning my journey into Software Engineering while working full-time as a Point of Sales Coordinator. To those who don't know what that is, I am basically the reason why your food increases and decreases in price. 

I am looking forward to learning more about programming and coding! Can't wait to show off my new skills.
